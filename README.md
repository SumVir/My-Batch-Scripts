# My-Batch-Scripts
Hi, I created some batch scripts during my Batch Scripting course. I will continue adding more as I write additional scripts for automation and security-related tasks.

# Notes
1. When running some scripts, make sure you have administrator privileges.
2. Some file paths may need to be adjusted depending on your system configuration.
